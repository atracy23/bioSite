            <h1>Home Remodeling</h1>
                <p>In his spare time, Craig loves working on the big old farmhouse that he and his wife 
                    bought to house all their kids.  He is currently working on building an office for
                    his wife that is about to start her new career in software development.  He gutted
                    an indoor patio attached to the garage.  He insulated, drywalled, mudded, and painted
                    the walls.  He installed new windows, siding, and shingles.  He leveled the floor and
                    installed new trim.  He also added several more outlets.</p>
                <p>Some of Craig's more recent projects include completely gutting and rebuilding a second floor 
                    bathroom for his three daughters.  He replaced the flooring with a newly leveled, tile floor.
                    He put in a new vanity, sink, and mirror.  He replaced the tub/shower combination
                    and toilet.  He put in new lights and exhaust fan.  With the help of his daughters, 
                    he repainted all the walls.  He also removed all of the wallpaper in all three of the 
                    upstairs bedrooms, orange peeled the walls, and painted.  </p>
                <p>Some of his original projects included installing new lighting, a new front door, and a porch swing
                    on the front porch. He built a batting cage for his family in the backyard as well as a practice field
                    for volleyball.  He put in new pipes throughout the house using new pex pipes and a water manifold
                    system. He also built a bedroom in the basement for one of his sons so everyone could have their own rooms.
                    Craig's next project is going to be rewiring and refinishing the movie room.</p>
